            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">The Steam website</a>
            <p><strong>Steam app download</strong></p>

            <p>For some odd reason Steam use's all of your internet so you won't be able to access to the internet
                unless you have muitlple internets or you set a limit to how much internet Steam can use.</p>
            <p>To set a limit for how much internet Steam can use, you first click on the Steam button on the top left
                hand corner.</p>
            <p>Remember you can zoom in to see better.</p>
