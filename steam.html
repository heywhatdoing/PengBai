            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Valve released Steam in September 11, 2003.</p>
            <p><strong>Before Steam, there were a few problems</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Valve had problems updating it's online games like Counter-Strike.</li>
                <li>If Valve updated the game, the whole online game service will disconnect for several days.</li>
                <li>Valve realized that 75% of users had high-speed internet connection so they wanted to make a gaming
                    platform to deliver game content faster to players then some other gaming platforms.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Valve decided to make a gaming platform that would automatically update and would have strong protection
                against hackers/cheaters and piracy.</p>
            <p>Lot's of people suppourted in the beta before Steam was released.</p>
            <h2>The growing features</h2>
            <p>Steam is starting to grow it's market and by May of 2007, there were 13 million accounts were created
                and
                150 games were an sale. The Steam Community was also released in 2007.</p>
            <p>Steamworks and the matchmaking system was made in 2008 so online games will be balanced.</p>
            <p>In 2009, the Steam Cloud was released so people can play the same save game automatically from different
                devices.</p>
            <p>By 2010, you can now play games on Mac OS X and Steam has made a Translation Server so you can help
                Valve translate everything to the 26 suppourted languages</p>
            <a href="https://translation.steampowered.com/">The link to the translation website</a>
            <p>In 2011, Steamworks is now suppourted on PlayStation 3 and the Steam Workshop is released.</p>
