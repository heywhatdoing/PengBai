            <h2>The Steam Workshop</h2>
            <p>The Steam Workshop is to create artwork, maps and items for a certain game.</p>
            <p>If the game supports the Steam Workshop, it will say Steam Workshop on the right hand side of the store
                page which means that game supports it.</p>
            <p>If you have downloaded the game, it will clearly say browse the Steam Workshop on the game page.</p>
            <p>In the Steam Workshop, you can probably see some random items and you can see catogorys on the right
                hand side spliting up the maps and items so you can browse maps instead of items.</p>
            <p>Once you chose what map or item or whatever, you will see the file details.</p>
            <h2>To Download</h2>
            <p>First you will need to subscribe to the creator.</p>
            <p>Next you will need to refresh to page.</p>
            <p>For me even though it says you need to refresh, the file downloaded automaticly.</p>
            <p>Once it's finished downloading, use the downloaded map or item or whatever.</p>
            <h2>Publishing a Workshop item</h2>
            <p><strong>Just saying I have never published a Workshop item before I will not be the best guide.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>I will just be linking you to some websites that might help.</strong></p>
            <p>The first one is just the wiki of creating models.</p>
            <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Model_Creation_Overview">Model Creation Overview</a>
            <p>The next one is just the Steam Support page about the Steam Workshop.</p>
            <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6718-JXNM-4879#stepsitem">Steam Workshop
                Support</a>
            <p>In the Steam Workshop page related to your game of choice, you might also see links to help you create
                items.</p>
